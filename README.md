This "Add Employee" App was completed in December 2017. The final deliverable is a combination of HTML, CSS, JS, JSON and handlebars code.

This app allows the user to add a new employee to an existing array of employees. It was specifically designed for managers or HR people who would want to add a new employee to an already existing database. Ultimately, this is the feature that separates this app from the React App that is also featured on my GitHub. Updates to the existing data are possible and encouraged with this App.

Once the button for "Add New Employee" is clicked, the user must fill out a form. A combination of textboxes, ladders, and checked/unchecked buttons are provided where appropriate to make the user experience more enjoyable, without being too distracting. Validation ensures that the information entered is correct and complete before adding the new employee to the database. 

The trickiest challenge of this project was getting the validation logic into proper syntax. If any of the validation checkpoints were not properly implemented, incomplete or incorrect forms could be submitted. Needless to say, I overcame this challenge by testing the app myself, and focusing my attention on the one module with the validation logic - most notably - "employee.hbs".

One valuable lesson I learned from making this project was the difference between "unless" and "if". Although both keywords may be used interchangeably, they are essentially two sides of the same coin. For example. If you say "If not true", you could say "unless" instead which makes the logic much easier to understand on a human level. Although not huge, arming myself with such knowledge is crucial because it made me think about problems in different ways.

Apart from adding new employees, it is also worth mentioning that the user of this App may also view the company departments and managers as well, by clicking on their respective buttons.

In the end, I achieved a final grade of A on this project.
